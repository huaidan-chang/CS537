For the efficiency test, the TA's will run your code on an isolated VM, so that the
environment is the same for everyone. Your implementation will be compared to a baseline
implementation written by the TA's that did not go through many optimizations. The number
of entries in the four files we will be using for comparison are: 10000, 500000, 499999, and
500001. Maybe these sizes will hint towards potential optimizations you could make... You can use the python file to generate tests with correctly sorted outputs to test your own implementation if you so choose.
