# About p2a
An implementation of a command line interpreter is the goal of this project. Wish is a shell that stands for Wisconsin Shell. This shell can be used in the same way as the Unix shell. There are two ways to use the shell: interactively, where you write commands line by line after being given a prompt, and batch, where you call the program and pass it a script file as an argument to run the commands in your script.

There are four built-in commands: exit, cd, path, and if statement.

## Usage
### interactive mode
```
prompt> ./wish
wish> 
```

### batch mode
```
prompt> ./wish batch.txt
```

### if-statement
```
prompt> if some_command == 0 then some_other_command fi
```
